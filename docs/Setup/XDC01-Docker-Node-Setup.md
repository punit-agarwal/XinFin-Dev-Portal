|:------:|:-----:|:---------- |
|21001-2100*| TCP/UDP | GETH |
|22001-2200*| TCP | RPC |
|23001-2300*| TCP | RAFT |
|9001-900*| TCP | Constellation |

*-auto-increment depending on number of nodes

### Clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/XinFinorg/XDC01-docker-Nnodes.git    
   
### Step: 1 Install docker & docker-compose
    sudo ./install_docker.sh

### Step: 2 Pull image from Docker Hub
    sudo docker pull xinfinorg/quorum:v2.1.0

### Step: 3 Launch the setup script

    cd static-nodes
    sudo ./setup.sh

   Enter number of nodes, private IP of host machine & unique docker subnet. 
   You can view private IP of your machine using `ifconfig`.

#### To Check private IP address(internal (network) IP address) on Ubuntu GUI:
  * Open the Activities overview and start typing Network.
  * Click on Network to open the panel.
  * Choose which connection, Wi-Fi or Wired, from the left pane.
  * The IP address for a wired connection will be displayed on the right.
  * Click the  settings button to see the IP address for the wireless network in the Details panel.


   `sudo docker-compose -p <PROJECT_NAME_STATIC_NODE> up -d` 
   
   *Replace <PROJECT_NAME_STATIC_NODE> with your project name.*

### Accessing console

    sudo docker exec -it PROJECT_NAME_STATIC_NODES_node_1_1 geth attach /qdata/dd/geth.ipc
    
### Stopping the network

    sudo docker-compose -p <PROJECT_NAME_STATIC_NODE> down

### Adding a new node to the existing network

#### Install docker & pull image on the new host machine as done earlier in Step 1 & 2

    cd dynamic-node
    sudo ./setup.sh
    
   Enter the public IP of the new host machine (private IP in case of local setup, assigned by router)
   Enter the node number (e.g. if you have 3 nodes up with the initial setup then node number here would be 4)
    
#### Copy enodeID from enode-url.json then attach to geth console of any running node & execute
    
    raft.addPeer(enodeID)

#### Start the new node
    cd dynamic-node
    sudo docker-compose -p <PROJECT_NAME_DYNAMIC_NODE> up -d
    
### Upgrade Network

#### Pull newer version of image from docker hub
    sudo docker pull xinfinorg/quorum:v2.x.x

#### Stop containers running old version
    sudo docker-compose -p <PROJECT_NAME_STATIC/DYNAMIC_NODE> down
    
#### Update docker-compose.yml to use new image (specify quorum:TAG_NAME as argument)
    sudo ./update_quorum.sh quorum:v2.x.x
  
#### Run new version     
    sudo docker-compose -p <PROJECT_NAME_STATIC/DYNAMIC_NODE> up -d
