### Setup DApp Environment

<br> 

### Prerequisites

#### 1. The Network for Running the Contract

Deploying and using contract will need to consume a certain amount of resource
(memory, CPU, and storage etc.). Therefore, it is recommended that the
developers tune and test their smart contracts on their private networks and
confirm that the contract is available before deploying them on the TestNet or
MainNet.

#### 2. Wallet Client

Wallet-cli is XDC Network’s command-line wallet. Developers can use wallet-cli
to post and deploy contracts on the MainNet as well as execute other operations.

### Smart Contract Development

At this point, we recommend [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) as the coding
environment for compiling and testing during the early stages. We present a simple
example of contract code of data access to illustrate the process of compiling,
deployment, and debugging.

#### **1. Initiate the Private Chain**

Make sure that the private chain in the prerequisite has been successfully
deployed by checking if log message “Produce block successfully” of persistent
block generation appears.

#### 2. Develop Smart Contracts

Copy the code mentioned above to Remix to compile and debug. Make sure that
logic of the code is correct, and the code itself is bug-free.

#### 3. Compile in SimpleWebCompiler

The compiler of XDC is slightly different from that of Ethereum and is still
integrating with Remix. Therefore, we are providing a temporary way of acquiring
ABI and ByteCode instead of acquiring them directly from Remix. Copy the code
above to SImpleWebCompiler and click the Compile button to attain ABI and
ByteCode.

#### 4. Deploy Smart Contract via Wallet-cli

**Download Wallet-Cli and compile on it.**


> *Note: Developers can make the change in config.conf if they need to connect to
> a different node or interface.*

**Initiate Wallet-Cli**

    #Command to initiate the wallet-CLI

After initiation, input the command interactively to the portal. Import the
private key and inquire if the remaining balance is correct.


**Contract Deployment**





A message of “Deploy the contract successfully” will be displayed upon the
success of contract deployment.

**Acquiring addresses of the contracts**



**Call the contracts to store and query data**





If the called function is constant or VIEW, wallet-cli will return the results
directly.
